I last taught this advanced-level MS course in fall 2013 in the IE&OR Department at Columbia University. 
It is a core course for the MS in Financial Engineering program at Columbia. I will not be posting solutions to 
the assignments or code / software so please don’t send me an email asking me to do so!
A syllabus and description of the course logistics can be found
[here](https://martin-haugh.github.io/files/ContinuousFE/IEOR_E4707_Logistics_2013.pdf).

### Lecture Notes

1. [Martingale Pricing in Discrete-Time and Discrete-Space](https://martin-haugh.github.io/files/ContinuousFE/)  
   (These are the notes from the Foundations of FE course as they are a little more up-to-date than the version I used in 2013.)
2. [An Introduction to Stochastic Calculus for Diffusions](https://martin-haugh.github.io/files/ContinuousFE/)
3. [Black-Scholes and the Volatility Surface](https://martin-haugh.github.io/files/ContinuousFE/)
4. [Foreign Exchange, ADR’s and Quanto Securities](https://martin-haugh.github.io/files/ContinuousFE/)
5. [Local Volatility, Stochastic Volatility and Jump-Diffusion Models](https://martin-haugh.github.io/files/ContinuousFE/)

The assignments for this course were drawn from the exercises at the end of each set of lecture notes.
