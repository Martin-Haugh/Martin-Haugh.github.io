I last taught this advanced-level MS course in fall 2016 in the IE&OR Department at Columbia University. It is an elective course for the MS in Financial Engineering and MS in Operations Research programs at Columbia. I will **not** be posting solutions to the assignments or code / software so please don’t send me an email asking me to do so! A syllabus and description of the course logistics can be found [here](https://martin-haugh.github.io/files/QRM/QRM_logistics2016.pdf).

A brief review of some derivatives pricing theory can be found [here](https://martin-haugh.github.io/files/QRM/DerivativesReview.pdf). It might be of some use for some parts of the course.
