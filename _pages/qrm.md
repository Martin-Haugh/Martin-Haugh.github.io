I last taught this advanced-level MS course in fall 2016 in the IE&OR Department at Columbia University. 
It is an elective course for the MS in Financial Engineering and MS in Operations Research programs at Columbia.  
I will **not** be posting solutions to the assignments or code / software so please donâ€™t send me an email asking me to do so!  
A syllabus and description of the course logistics can be found [here](https://martin-haugh.github.io/files/QRM/QRM_logistics2016.pdf).
