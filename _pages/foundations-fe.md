I last taught this MS course in fall 2016 in the IE&OR Department at Columbia University. It is a core course for 
the MS in Financial Engineering program at Columbia and is intended to introduce the main topics in quantitative 
finance to the students in the program. The emphasis is on modeling, markets and financial problems and products. 
Hence stochastic calculus only plays a modest role in the course. I will not be posting solutions to the assignments 
or code / software so please donâ€™t send me an email asking me to do so!  A syllabus and description of the course 
logistics can be found [here](https://martin-haugh.github.io/files/FoundationsFE/Syllabus-FoundationsFE_2016.pdf).

### Lecture Notes

3. Term Structure Models
4. Mean-Variance Analysis and the CAPM
5. Stochastic Calculus
