I have been at Imperial College Business School since September 2017. Prior to that I spent more than 10 years in the Department of IE & OR at Columbia University as well as 4 years working in the hedge fund industry in New York and London.

## Teaching
My teaching blah

In spring 2013 I co-taught with Garud Iyengar one of the first three MOOCs, i.e. massive open online courses, to be offered by Columbia University. The course was called Financial Engineering and Risk Management and it also featured an interview with Emanuel Derman. This course has now been split into two separate 6-week courses, [FE & RM Part I](https://www.coursera.org/course/fe1) and [FE & RM Part II](https://www.coursera.org/course/fe2). Business Insider listed FE & RM Part I as one of the [best free online business courses](http://www.businessinsider.com/best-free-online-business-courses-2013-10?op=1). In 2013 I was also awarded the Columbia Engineering School Alumni Associationâ€™s Distinguished Faculty Teaching Award for excellence in teaching.
