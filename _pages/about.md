I am an Associate Professor of Analytics and Operations Research at [Imperial College Business School](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/business-school/) where I have been since September 2017. Prior to that I spent more than 10 years in the Department of IE & OR at Columbia University as well as 4 years working as a quant  in the hedge fund industry in New York and London. I have a Ph.D. in [Operations Research](http://orc.mit.edu/) from MIT and MSc degrees in [Applied Statistics](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/) and [Mathematics](https://www.ucc.ie/en/matsci/) from the University of Oxford and University College Cork, respectively.

## Research
My main research interests are: 

1. _Quantitative finance and risk management_    
   <sup> Recently I've been working on problems related to portfolio optimization with taxes as well as scenario analysis in risk managment.</sup>  
2. _Dynamic programing and stochastic control_   
   <sup> blah blah blah </sup>
3. _Data analytics_  
   <small> I've been working in the area of sports analytics recently and have also begun working on some problems related to politics and the electoral college of U.S. presidential elections. </small>

My research papers can be found [here](/publications).

## Teaching
My teaching blah

In spring 2013 I co-taught with Garud Iyengar one of the first three MOOCs, i.e. massive open online courses, to be offered by Columbia University. The course was called Financial Engineering and Risk Management and it also featured an interview with Emanuel Derman. This course has now been split into two separate 6-week courses, [FE & RM Part I](https://www.coursera.org/course/fe1) and [FE & RM Part II](https://www.coursera.org/course/fe2). Business Insider listed FE & RM Part I as one of the [best free online business courses](http://www.businessinsider.com/best-free-online-business-courses-2013-10?op=1). In 2013 I was also awarded the Columbia Engineering School Alumni Associationâ€™s Distinguished Faculty Teaching Award for excellence in teaching.
